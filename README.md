### Strong Typing
The `Strong_Typing` folder demonstrates how TypeScript enforces strict typing, ensuring that each variable, parameter, or return value has a specific type. Strong typing reduces runtime errors by catching them during the compilation process.

### Types
In the `Types` folder, you’ll find examples of how TypeScript uses various data types, including `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and custom types. This section shows how you can define and use these types to create more predictable and manageable code.

### Inferred Typing
The `inferred_typing` folder illustrates TypeScript’s ability to infer types based on the initial value assigned to a variable. This allows for implicit typing without explicitly defining the type, making code cleaner while still providing type safety.

### Duck Typing
The `duck_typing` folder provides examples of TypeScript’s structural typing. Duck typing, or structural typing, determines compatibility based on structure rather than explicit type definitions, allowing for flexible and reusable code.

### Arrays
The `arrays` folder contains examples showing how to work with arrays in TypeScript, including type-safe arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and tuples. TypeScript enforces that array elements adhere to the specified types, preventing accidental type mismatches.

### Any
In the `any` folder, you’ll explore the `any` type, which provides flexibility when a variable's type is unknown at compile time. While `any` is powerful, it reduces type safety, so use it sparingly.

### Functions
The `functions` folder demonstrates TypeScript’s support for typed functions, including how to define parameter types, return types, and function signatures. TypeScript ensures that functions receive and return values of the expected types.

### Optional Parameters
The `optional_parameters` folder contains examples of how to work with optional parameters in TypeScript functions. Optional parameters allow you to make certain arguments optional, enabling functions to handle different use cases with flexibility.

### Interface
The `Interface` folder showcases TypeScript interfaces, which define the shape of an object, including its properties and types. Interfaces help create consistent structures and enforce rules in object-oriented code, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

### JavaScript vs. TypeScript Comparison

Each folder in this repository includes both JavaScript and TypeScript examples to compare and contrast the differences between these two languages. The comparisons show how TypeScript’s type system and features provide a more robust development experience, especially for larger and more complex applications.
